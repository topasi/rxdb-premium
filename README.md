# RxDB Premium

This module contains the [premium plugins](https://rxdb.info/premium) of RxDB.

## Installation

The [RxDB premium](https://rxdb.info/premium) module is distributed via npm and downloads+decrypts the actual code in the `postinstall` hook.
 
1. Add `rxdb-premium` to your dependencies in the `package.json`. You can find out the newest [RxDB version here](https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb/releases).

```json
{
    "dependencies": {
        "rxdb": "XX.X.X",
        "rxdb-premium": "XX.X.X"
    }
}
```


2. Add your access token to the `package.json` of your project. 

```json
{
    "accessTokens": {
        "rxdb-premium": "0x7ff6230..."
    }
}
```

**NOTICE:** On install, `rxdb-premium` will look in all package.json files in all parent paths to find the token. So when you have a multi-module project, it is enough to put the token into the root `package.json`.


3. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.


**NOTICE:**
- You should always pin the version and do not use version ranges.
- The major version of your `rxdb-premium` package must be the same as of `rxdb`.

## Source Code Access

If you have purchased the source code access option, you can find the source code in the installed rxdb premium folder in your node_modules. `node_modules/rxdb-premium/src`
